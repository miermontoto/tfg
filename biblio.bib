  abstract = {Big data is a collection of massive and complex data sets and data volume that include the huge quantities of data, data management capabilities, social media analytics and real-time data. Big data analytics is the process of examining large amounts of data. There exist large amounts of heterogeneous digital data. Big data is about data volume and large data set's measured in terms of terabytes or petabytes. This phenomenon is called Bigdata. After examining of Bigdata, the data has been launched as Big Data analytics. In this paper, presenting the 5Vs characteristics of big data and the technique and technology used to handle big data. The challenges include capturing, analysis, storage, searching, sharing, visualization, transferring and privacy violations. It can neither be worked upon by using traditional SQL queries nor can the relational database management system (RDBMS) be used for storage. Though, a wide variety of scalable database tools and techniques has evolved. Hadoop is an open source distributed data processing is one of the prominent and well known solutions. The NoSQL has a non-relational database with the likes of MongoDB from Apache.}
